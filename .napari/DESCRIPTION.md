# Description

View datasets archived at the **[Brain Image Library](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/)**.

**NOTE: This plugin is under early development.  Currently, only a subset of single-channel, fMOST datasets which include projections are available to view.  An example can be found [here]( https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/2b/da/2bdaf9e66a246844/mouseID_405429-182725/).

### Features

* Multiscale Rendering
  * In datasets that include multiple resolution representations of the data, each resolution can be combined to improve the speed of browsing and user experience.  An example of a dataset with multiple resolution projections can be found [here](https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/2b/da/2bdaf9e66a246844/mouseID_405429-182725/).
  * All datasets included in the current release of napari-bil-data-viewer use multi-resolution datasets.
* 3D rendering of whole datasets.  The lowest resolution is used for rendering.  Currently, this is a limitation imposed by napari.
* The plugin does NOT require a BIL account as datasets are already accessible via https.

### Known Issues / limitations
* Currently the only datasets that are available are those which have been manually selected by the developers.  If you would like a specific dataset to be included please consider adding the dataset(s) to the [dataset_info.py](https://github.com/brain-image-library/napari-bil-data-viewer/blob/main/napari_bil_data_viewer/dataset_info.py) file and submitting a pull request.
* To inquire about this plugin please contact Brain Image Library support:  bil-support@psc.edu
* The plugin is still under development.  We appreciate all [reports of issues / errors](https://github.com/brain-image-library/napari-bil-data-viewer/issues) which occur during use.
